Follow strict TypeScript conventions: use `type` not `interface`, export all types, no `any` types, use type guards for validation. Optimize for O(1)/O(log n) complexity - avoid O(n²), use Maps/Sets instead of nested loops. Follow TDD: write tests before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor). See .ai/rules.md for complete guidelines.",
