# Riflebird AI Coding Rules

Riflebird's coding standards are split into the following domain-specific files. Refer to them for detailed rules.

## Rule Index

- **[Architecture](.agent/rules/architecture.md)**: Core design patterns, adapter abstraction, integration points.
- **[Workflows](.agent/rules/workflows.md)**: Test generation flows, adapter implementation rules.
- **[Build & Configuration](.agent/rules/build-config.md)**: Monorepo structure, Zod validation, environment variables.
- **[Naming](.agent/rules/naming.md)**: File naming, test naming, code conventions.
- **[TypeScript](.agent/rules/typescript.md)**: Strict type rules, no `any`, error handling, type definitions.
- **[Testing](.agent/rules/testing.md)**: TDD, testing strategy, quick commands.
- **[Performance](.agent/rules/performance.md)**: Complexity rules, memory optimization.

## Project Overview
Riflebird is an AI-powered test generation and execution framework that supports unit, integration, E2E, visual, and performance testing across multiple testing frameworks (Vitest, Jest, Playwright, Cypress, Puppeteer, WebdriverIO).
