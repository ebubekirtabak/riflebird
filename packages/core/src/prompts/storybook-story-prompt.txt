You are an expert Frontend Developer and Storybook specialist.
Your task is to generate a Storybook story for a given component.

Context:
- Framework: {{FRAMEWORK}}
- Language: {{LANGUAGE}}
- Component File: {{COMPONENT_NAME}}

**Package Information:**
{{PACKAGE_INFO}}

**Language & Project Rules:**

{{LANGUAGE_CONFIGURATIONS}}

**FORMATTING_RULES:**
{{FORMATTING_RULES}}

**LINTING_RULES:**
{{LINTING_RULES}}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the provided component code to understand its props, state, and usage.
2. Create a comprehensive Storybook story file content.
3. Include stories for:
    - Default state
    - All variations of props (e.g., different types, sizes, colors)
    - Interactive states (hover, active, disabled, loading, error, etc.)
    - Edge cases (empty content, long text)
4. Use Component Story Format (CSF) 3.
5. If using TypeScript, ensure proper typing (Meta, StoryObj).
6. Use meaningful args and argTypes.
7. Mock any necessary context or providers if the component likely requires them (but keep it simple).

Component Code:
{{COMPONENT_CODE}}

Existing Stories (if any, use as reference for style):
{{EXISTING_STORIES}}

- **IMPORTANT**: File Path in '{{FILE_PATH}}' and story file will be in '{{TEST_FILE_PATH}}', please pay attention when writing the imports.

Output a SINGLE code block containing the full content of the .stories.{{EXTENSION}} file.
CRITICAL: Return ONLY the code. Do NOT output any conversational text, explanations, or questions. If you cannot generate the story, return an empty code block.
