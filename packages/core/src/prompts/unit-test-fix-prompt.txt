You are an expert senior software testing engineer. The following test(s) have FAILED. Your task is to analyze the errors and generate a CORRECTED version of the ENTIRE test file.

**Test Framework:** {{TEST_FRAMEWORK}}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **FIX THE ERRORS** - Address all issues identified in the failing tests
2. **MAINTAIN TEST INTENT** - Keep the same test coverage and purpose
3. **NO HALLUCINATED SELECTORS** - Only use selectors that exist in the rendered HTML
4. **Use {{TEST_FRAMEWORK}} exclusively** - No other frameworks
5. **MANDATORY CLEANUP** - Implement proper `afterEach` blocks
6. **RETURN COMPLETE FILE** - Include all tests (passing and fixed) in your response

**Testing Framework Configuration:**
{{TEST_FRAMEWORK_CONFIG}}

**Package Information:**
{{PACKAGE_INFO}}

Use the package manager and dependency information to ensure compatibility with installed versions.

**Language & Project Rules:**

{{LANGUAGE_CONFIGURATIONS}}

{{FORMATTING_RULES}}

{{LINTING_RULES}}

**FULL TEST FILE (for context):**
File: {{TEST_FILE_PATH}}

```
{{FAILED_TEST_CODE}}
```

**FAILING TEST(S) WITH SPECIFIC ERRORS:**

{{FAILING_TESTS_DETAIL}}

**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Read each failing test's error message carefully
2. If HTML/DOM output is provided, verify your selectors match the ACTUAL rendered elements
3. Check the test code line by line against the errors
4. Identify specific issues (wrong selectors, missing awaits, incorrect assertions, etc.)
5. Generate a COMPLETE corrected test file with ALL tests included
6. Ensure failing tests are fixed while preserving passing tests

**SOURCE FILE BEING TESTED:**
File: {{FILE_PATH}}

```
{{CODE_SNIPPET}}
```

**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Generate the COMPLETE corrected test file
- Include ALL necessary imports explicitly
- **IMPORT RULE**: Import EVERY function you use from {{TEST_FRAMEWORK}}
- Fix ALL identified errors
- Maintain the same test structure and coverage
- Follow project conventions exactly
- Tests must be immediately runnable
- NO explanations or comments in the output
- **IMPORTANT**: Pay attention to import paths - from {{FILE_PATH}} to {{TEST_FILE_PATH}}
